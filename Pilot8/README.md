# wp2pilots
This pilot investigates the linkages between research outputs of R&I projects in Europe. We apply social network analysis to model the linkages between grants, publications and software and analyse the impact of private and public funding of R&I projects. We discuss a a set of indicators for quantifying these linkages and apply this methodology on two datasets of R&I projects.
